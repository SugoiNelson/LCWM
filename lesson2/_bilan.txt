Computers are big calculators.
They can do basic tasks : adding, substracting, multiply, dividing and remainder calculation.
Algorithms, being complex tasks, need to be programmed.
It basically means that we, as developers, have to explain to the machine how to do them
using the basic tasks they know how to do.

That being said, once we explained to the computer how to do a complex task, we don't need to teach him twice,
we can just tell him to remember what we taught it earlier and we can achieve this by simply
including the library we (or someone else) wrote and calling the right method.
