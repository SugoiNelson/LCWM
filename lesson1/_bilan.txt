Computers have multiple memories.
From fastest to slowest : registers, cache, RAM and ROM.

To "remember" a piece of information, our program needs to stock data in memory.
It uses RAM to do so.
Registers and cache are used for performances but it works automatically so we won't need to worry about it (yet).

In our source code, we temporarily stock data in variables, the variable's value can change while the code is being processed. 

We can also talk about constants which value can't be changed.

There's multiple variable types depending on their value or size.
For instance, an "int" is a variable type which purpose is to stock integers,
"doubles" are for decimals.

Chars are integers, capital A for instance is "65", B is "66", C is "67", etc.

Strings are arrays of chars, each index acts as a pointer to one char in the string.

The "#include" method allows us to include libraries, i.e. groups of other methods declared in a binary file.

For instance, the "stdio.h" library allows our program to listen to inputs and to return an output. For instance :
  - the 'printf' method to display something in our console
  - the 'scanf' method to ask a user for an input
