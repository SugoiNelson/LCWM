Learn C With Me

## What is this

A repo where I will put source code from my C exercises.
Most comments / explanations are in french.
I'll probably translate everything later.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1

- **hello** : including libraries and calling functions
- **variable** : declaring variables
- **args** : how to ask the user for an input

### Lesson 2

- **calc** : how to do quick maths
- **io_calc** : same as above but with user input
- **short_calc** : how to to quicker maths
- **math** : using the math library to do even quicker maths

### Lesson 3

- **bool** : declaring booleans (since they aren't implemented by default)
- **if** : running code when a condition has been respected
- **switch** : an if equivalent

### Lesson 4

- **while** & **do_while** : basic loops
- **for** : basic loop where we know how many time we want the code to be executed

### Lesson 5

- How to organize our C programs (one file)

### Lesson 6

- **betterPrint** : How to configure printf()

### Lesson 7

- **dataTypes** : Lesson on the difference between primitive and complex data types.

## Exercises

## How to contribute

You want to help me get better at C? Here's how you can help :

- Fork this repo and create a new branch
- Create a new "exercise" folder
- Add a C file with either : a comment asking me to write a program or a non-working program for me to fix
- Once I'm done, you'll be able to correct the exercise and/or explain how you would have done it.
